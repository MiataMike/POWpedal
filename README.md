# POWpedal
The design goal of this project is to test Germanium transistors' clipping charactaristics in a guitar pedal that adjusts amplitude and bias for both hard and soft clipping in the same tone.

## Simulations
These simulations use a SPICE-like tool called TINA-TI available for download here: https://www.ti.com/tool/TINA-TI

### TODO
Find the operating conditions (Beta of transistors and amplitude of guitar pickups) and make sure the gain is adjustable so the quietest combo can still distort and the loudest can play clean

#### Transistor types

* GE 2N107 x4
* RCA 2n370 x2
* RCA 2N1265/5 x1
* CK722 x2 (one "bad")
