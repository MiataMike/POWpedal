# POWpedal
The design goal of this project is to test Germanium transistors' clipping charactaristics in a guitar pedal that adjusts amplitude and bias for both hard and soft clipping in the same tone.

## Simulations
These simulations use a SPICE-like tool called TINA-TI available for download here: https://www.ti.com/tool/TINA-TI

### TODO
Find the operating conditions (Beta [aka hFE] of transistors and amplitude of guitar pickups) and make sure the gain is adjustable so the quietest combo can still distort and the loudest can play clean
